/*
 * A reader at work on one desk heard nothing when a panel on another desk
 * sent them something (#122), so it rises in this desk's corner as a small
 * card -- who sent it, its title, Open and Later. It used to go at the first
 * click elsewhere, with nothing left on the desk to find it by: the reader
 * who missed it had lost it (plan b0bca0a11f). So the card is the corner's
 * (ui/corner.js `rise`), and it settles into the pill: the document is in
 * the tray under Lately, kept, with the pill's dot lit until it is seen.
 * This desk's own documents are the rail's, at the top of Documents, and do
 * not rise -- but for its first: a reader new to snyvi, working in the
 * panel, never looked at the rail's edge, so the first page a desk is sent
 * rises too, once, and says where pages live. The panel that sent it says
 * so in its head as well (rail.js `pageChips`), for every page, until it is
 * read.
